4. **Content**: Show actual car/bike washing services, not stock photos
5. **Branding**: Consider including AutoClean BD branding or equipment

## Sources for Images

- Professional photography of your actual services
- Stock photo websites (ensure commercial license)
- Professional car wash businesses (with permission)
- Automotive detailing companies (with permission)

## File Formats

- **Preferred**: JPG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency
- **Optimization**: Compress images for web use (under 500KB each)
- **Naming**: Keep the exact filenames as specified above

## Implementation

Once you have the images:
1. Replace the placeholder files with actual images
2. Ensure the images are optimized for web
3. Test the website to ensure all images load correctly
4. The website will automatically display the images with the premium dark theme styling

## Fallback

The website includes `onerror="this.style.display='none'"` attributes, so if images fail to load, they will be hidden gracefully without breaking the layout.
